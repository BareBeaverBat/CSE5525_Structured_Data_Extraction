I was caught in a downpour on the second day, and everything inside stayed perfectly dry thanks to its waterproof material.

Loud shouting could be heard from inside apartment 304. After knocking and announcing police presence, a woman answered the door and invited officers inside the residence. The verbal altercation was between two adult occupants of the unit. Multiple neighbors had called to complain about the noise level. After separate interviews and mediation, one party voluntarily agreed to stay with family for the night. Situation was de-escalated and no further action required.",
