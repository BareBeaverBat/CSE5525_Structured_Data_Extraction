This dual approach will provide unprecedented insights into pediatric health patterns over time. The weekly data collection schedule will ensure continuous monitoring of intervention effects while minimizing participant burden. Our team has extensive experience in pediatric research and has established strong relationships with local school districts to facilitate recruitment.
