    "Subject: SoundBlaster ZxR Audio Cutting Out Intermittently\n\nI'm having a major issue with my SoundBlaster ZxR. The audio keeps cutting out intermittently. It happens while I'm playing games and also while I'm just listening to music. This started happening about a week ago after I updated my graphics drivers, but rolling back the drivers didn't fix the issue.\n\nMy operating system is Windows 11 and I'm using the Firefox browser. I've tried different headphones and speakers, and the problem persists. I've also checked all the physical connections, and everything seems to be plugged in correctly. Let me know what additional information you need from me. This issue is seriously impacting my ability to use my computer for entertainment, and I'd appreciate a prompt resolution.",
    "My Logitech G915 TKL Tactile keyboard is completely unusable. I keep getting error codes 404 and 401, which is completely blocking me from using it. This happens every single time I try to use it. My OS is macOS Ventura and I have a mouse and keyboard connected. I've tried restarting my computer several times, but the issue persists. I need this fixed ASAP as it's my primary keyboard for work. I bought this keyboard just last month. Can you please help me resolve this issue?",
    "Subject: Minor audio issue with Audio-Technica ATH-M50x on iOS 16.1\n\nHi,\n\nI'm experiencing a minor issue with my Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones. When connected to my iPhone running iOS 16.1, the audio occasionally cuts out for a split second. It's not a huge problem, but it's noticeable and a bit annoying, especially when listening to music. I’ve tried unplugging and replugging the headphones, but that doesn’t seem to fix it. I bought the headphones about six months ago from Amazon. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
    "Subject: Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 (v1.0.3) Not Working - Error 0x0001\n\nHi Elgato Support,\n\nMy Elgato Stream Deck MK.2 (version 1.0.3) has stopped working correctly. I'm getting the error code 0x0001. This started happening yesterday evening and has persisted since. I have a webcam connected to my computer. Unfortunately, I can't reproduce the error reliably. Sometimes it happens when I try to launch the Stream Deck software, other times it seems to occur randomly while I'm using it. I've tried restarting my computer, but the problem persists. This is completely blocking my ability to use the Stream Deck, which I need for my live streams. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex",
    "Subject: Minor cosmetic issue with BenQ EX3210U monitor\n\nHi BenQ Support,\n\nI'm experiencing a minor cosmetic issue with my BenQ EX3210U monitor (IPS model). It's not affecting functionality, but it is a bit distracting. There's a slight discoloration in the bottom right corner of the screen, almost like a faint yellow tinge. It's only noticeable on lighter backgrounds, like when I'm browsing the web in Chrome or working on a document.\n\nI'm running Windows 10 and I have a webcam connected to my computer. The issue happens sometimes, not every time I use the monitor. I can reproduce it, though not reliably. Sometimes it appears after the monitor has been on for a while, other times it's there right from startup. I've tried restarting my computer and power cycling the monitor, but the discoloration persists. I'd appreciate any help you can provide.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex"
