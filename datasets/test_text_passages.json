  "I am writing to report a car accident that occurred in Seattle, WA. A police report has been filed. I estimate the damages to my vehicle to be around $100.  The other driver's insurance company has already contacted me and will likely handle the situation as quickly as possible. Could you please let me know what additional steps I need to take from my end? I want to make sure I do everything correctly according to the terms of my policy. I have been with your company for over 10 years and this is my first claim so I would really appreciate the guidance.\n",
  "On July 17, 2024, a fire occurred at my apartment (number 3B) in Philadelphia. I estimate the damages to be around $1,000.  Two people witnessed the fire: Ashley Martinez (555-765-4321) and Christopher Anderson. They live across the hall in apartment 3A and happened to be home at the time. I was making toast when the toaster oven malfunctioned and caught fire. Luckily, I managed to put it out quickly with a fire extinguisher, but not before it damaged the countertop and some nearby cabinets. The cabinets were especially damaged by the chemicals in the fire extinguisher and probably need replacing.",
  "On July 25, 2024, my property located at 456 Elm St, Miami, FL 33139 experienced significant flooding due to unusually heavy rainfall that overwhelmed the drainage systems in my neighborhood. The floodwaters entered my home, causing extensive damage to furniture, electronics, and flooring. I estimate the total damages to be around $15,000.  I did not file a police report as this was a weather-related incident and not a crime.  However, two of my neighbors, Jane Smith (phone: 555-123-4567) and Peter Jones (email: peter.jones@example.com), witnessed the flooding and can corroborate the extent of the damage to my property. The rain began around 3 PM and continued until past 9 PM. By morning, the water had receded enough that I could start assessing the damage.\n",

  "I am writing to file a claim for a fire incident that caused significant damage to the insured property.  The estimated cost of the damages is $10,000.  A neighbor, Sarah Lee, witnessed the fire and can be reached at 555-987-6543 for further information. I had just finished grilling some burgers in my backyard around 6pm when I noticed the flames coming from the side of the house. I grabbed the garden hose and tried to put it out, but by then it was too late, and the fire had already spread through the back of the house. At that point I decided the best thing to do was to call the fire department and make sure everyone was out of the house safely.",
