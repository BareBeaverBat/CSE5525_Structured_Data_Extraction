The text passage describes a role as \"Junior Software Engineer\" at \"Tableau\" starting in \"June 2021\" and still ongoing (\"Present\"), which can be mapped to this field.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the \"contact_info\" field in the schema\nThe schema defines \"contact_info\" as an object containing \"email\" and \"phone\".
