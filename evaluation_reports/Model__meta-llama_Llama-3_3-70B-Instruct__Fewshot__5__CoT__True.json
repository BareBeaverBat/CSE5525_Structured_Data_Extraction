Since the property is described as a \"quarter-acre lot\" and not as a built house or apartment, it's implied that the lot is vacant and does not have bedrooms. Therefore, this field should not be included in the JSON object.\n\n2. **bathrooms**: Similar to the bedrooms, there is no mention of bathrooms because the property is a vacant lot. This field should not be included.\n\n3. **square_footage**: The text mentions a \"12,000 square foot parcel,\" which refers to the size of the lot rather than the square footage of a building. Since the schema's square_footage field seems to imply the size of a structure, and the property is a vacant lot, this field might not directly apply. However, given the context, it could be argued that the size of the lot is what's being described, but strictly following the schema's implication towards built structures, this field should not be included or should be interpreted with caution.\n\n4. **property_type**: The property is described as a \"quarter-acre lot,\" which best fits the \"land\" category in the schema's enum for property_type.\n\n5. **amenities**: The text mentions \"natural high desert landscaping,\" \"mountain views,\" and proximity to \"outdoor recreation,\" as well as \"shopping and dining options.\" However, these are not directly listed as amenities in the schema's enum. The only directly relevant amenity from the schema's perspective might be inferred as \"natural beauty\" or similar, but since these are not explicitly listed in the schema, and to strictly follow the schema, this field should not be included with the given options.\n\n6. **listing_price**: The property is listed at \"$185,000.\"\n\n7. **location**: The property is located in \"Bend, Oregon,\" with a \"97701\" zip code.\n\nGiven this analysis, the JSON object that captures the schema-relevant information from the text passage is:\n\n```json\n\nJSON document was here\n\n```",

The project is expected to span 18 months and be completed in six phases.  The new building will incorporate sustainable design principles and comply with all applicable building codes and regulations.  Ample parking will be provided on-site, exceeding the minimum requirements stipulated by local ordinances.  Construction will utilize locally sourced materials where possible, minimizing environmental impact and supporting local businesses.\n",

These can be directly mapped to the \"skills\" field in the schema.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the \"education\" field in the schema\nThe schema defines \"education\" as an array of objects, each containing \"degree_type\", \"major\", and \"institution\". The text passage mentions two educational backgrounds: \"Ph.D. in Computer Science\" from \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" and \"B.S. in Mathematics\" from \"California Institute of Technology\".

The text passage mentions a \"Bachelor of Science in Computer Science\" from the \"University of Washington\", which fits this structure.\n\n## Step 3: Analyzing the \"previous_roles\" field in the schema\nThe schema defines \"previous_roles\" as an array of objects, each containing details about a previous role such as \"title\", \"company\", \"start_month\", \"start_year\", \"end_month\", and \"end_year\". The text passage describes a role as \"Junior Software Engineer\" at \"Tableau\" starting in \"June 2021\" and still ongoing (\"Present\"), which can be mapped to this field.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the \"contact_info\" field in the schema\nThe schema defines \"contact_info\" as an object containing \"email\" and \"phone\". The text passage provides both an email address (\"sarah.chen@domain.net\") and a phone number (\"206-555-0199\"), which can be directly mapped to this field.\n\n## Step 5: Creating the JSON object\nBased on the analysis, the JSON object should include the \"skills\", \"education\", \"previous_roles\", and \"contact_info\" as they all have relevant information in the text passage.\n\nThe final answer is: \n```json\n\nJSON document was here\n\n```",

Our study will enroll 300 children between the ages of 5 and 17, following them over a four-year period to track developmental trajectories and response to intervention. The research combines weekly clinical measurements with structured surveys to capture both objective health parameters and patient-reported outcomes. This dual approach will provide unprecedented insights into pediatric health patterns over time. The weekly data collection schedule will ensure continuous monitoring of intervention effects while minimizing participant burden. Our team has extensive experience in pediatric research and has established strong relationships with local school districts to facilitate recruitment. The findings will address critical gaps in our understanding of pediatric health outcomes and inform future intervention strategies. We anticipate that this research will lead to improved treatment protocols and better health outcomes for children.",
